# ICCU Newsletters
A script which converts Markdown content into a fluid HTML web page which can be sent as an email.

This project was created as a generator for [Imperial College Christian Union's](iccu.co.uk) weekly email newsletters to members.

## Installation
Download and install [**Python 3**](https://www.python.org/downloads/), then clone this repo.

## Usage
1. Based on `example.md`, write the content of the newsletter in Markdown. Save this into the same folder as this repo.
2. Run `python3 compile.py [the name of your markdown file]`
3. The generated web page appears in the `compiled/` folder
